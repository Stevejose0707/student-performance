The notebook "student performance.ipynb" by Stevejose0707 provides an in-depth analysis of factors influencing students' academic performance. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, it examines variables such as gender, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course status, alongside scores in math, reading, and writing.

Key Findings:

Gender Differences: Female students generally outperform male students in reading and writing, while male students slightly excel in math.

Parental Education: Higher parental education levels correlate with better student performance across all subjects.

Lunch Type: Students receiving standard lunches typically score higher than those with free or reduced lunches.

Test Preparation: Completing a test preparation course is associated with improved scores in all subjects.

The analysis employs various data visualization techniques to illustrate these relationships and concludes with recommendations for educators and policymakers to enhance student outcomes.
